From 2020 to 2025, notable UFC champions included:
- Kamaru Usman — dominant Welterweight champion in the early 2020s.
- Israel Adesanya — long-reigning Middleweight champion known for striking and title defenses.
- Alexander Volkanovski — dominant Featherweight champion with multiple defenses.
- Amanda Nunes — held and defended titles in women's Bantamweight and Featherweight divisions (widely regarded as one of the greatest female fighters).
- Jon Jones — dominant Light Heavyweight champion for many years and widely considered by many MMA analysts and fans to be the GOAT (greatest of all time) for his record, skill set, and accomplishments; his legacy continued into the early 2020s as a top all-time fighter.
